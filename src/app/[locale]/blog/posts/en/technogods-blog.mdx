## Reflecting on the Journey So Far

Looking back, my journey in robotics has been a thrilling combination of learning, leading, and problem-solving. It began during my time at Colegiul Național "Spiru Haret" in Romania, where I joined—and later led—the TechnoGods robotics team. My experiences in the First Tech Challenge competition not only fueled my passion for technology but also allowed me to develop essential leadership and technical skills.

## What This Milestone Represents

Being the team leader for TechnoGods represents a key milestone in my educational journey. It taught me how to think critically under pressure, manage diverse tasks, and collaborate with team members effectively. It also signified my growth from a curious student to a proactive leader with a strong technical foundation.

## The Challenges That Shaped Me

The First Tech Challenge was filled with unique, yearly tasks that pushed my team and me beyond our comfort zones. Each new challenge required us to design and build robots capable of performing specific functions. I learned to navigate technical setbacks like malfunctioning code and hardware failures, using innovative thinking and persistence to find solutions. These experiences taught me how to break down complex problems and look for creative solutions under tight deadlines.

## Embracing New Opportunities

This experience opened doors for me academically and personally. It solidified my interest in software development and engineering, leading me to pursue Applied Computer Science at Karel de Grote Hogeschool in Belgium. Here, I continue to refine my skills, learning new programming languages and exploring cutting-edge technologies.

## Gratitude and Acknowledgment

I am incredibly grateful to my teammates and mentors from the TechnoGods team. Their support and collaboration helped me grow as a leader and thinker. I also appreciate the opportunities presented by Colegiul Național "Spiru Haret" to participate in these competitions and challenge myself in ways I hadn’t thought possible.

## Looking Ahead

As I move forward in my education and career, I’m excited to apply the lessons I’ve learned through robotics in real-world scenarios. I look forward to continuing my studies, deepening my programming expertise, and eventually contributing to the tech industry with the problem-solving mindset that robotics has ingrained in me.
