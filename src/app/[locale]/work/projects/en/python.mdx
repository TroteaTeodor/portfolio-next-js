## Overview

On my GitHub repository, I have curated a collection of Python projects that reflect my growth as a developer. These projects range from classic games to creative problem-solving scripts, showcasing my ability to tackle challenges with Python.

## Highlights of My Projects

### 1. Hangman

Description: A classic word-guessing game where players try to guess the hidden word before the "hangman" is complete.

Key Features:

Interactive gameplay with live feedback on guesses.

Randomized word selection to keep the game engaging.

Clean and easy-to-read code structure.

### 2. Number Guessing Game

Description: A fun game where the player tries to guess a random number within a given range.

Key Features:

Adjustable difficulty levels (range customization).

Provides hints such as "higher" or "lower" to guide players.

Demonstrates the use of random number generation and loops.

### 3. Rock-Paper-Scissors

Description: A simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

Key Features:

Allows the player to compete against the computer.

Validates user input to ensure a smooth gaming experience.

Implements game logic to determine the winner.

### 4. Word Guess

Description: A word-based guessing game similar to Hangman but with unique gameplay mechanics.

Key Features:

Displays progress as players guess letters correctly.

Tracks the number of guesses remaining.

Reinforces the fundamentals of string manipulation and loops.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Core**: Demonstrated expertise in Python basics, including loops, conditionals, and input handling.
- **Libraries**: Leveraged Python's random module to introduce randomness in games.
- **Git**: Used Git for version control and to manage project updates effectively.

## Challenges and Learnings

Input Validation: Learned to handle edge cases and validate user inputs for better user experiences.

Game Logic Design: Developed logical thinking to implement game rules and mechanics.

Improved Coding Practices: Enhanced code readability by using meaningful variable names and comments.

## Outcome

These projects allowed me to strengthen my foundational programming skills while having fun building games and solving problems. They also showcase my ability to design interactive applications and tackle common coding challenges.
