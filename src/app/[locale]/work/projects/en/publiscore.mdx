## Overview

PubliScore is a web application designed to help users evaluate the public transport accessibility of any location in Antwerp. By integrating open data from OpenStreetMap and local transport providers, PubliScore offers real-time scoring, interactive maps, and AI-powered recommendations. The platform is ideal for students, eco-conscious residents, and urban planners seeking to make data-driven decisions about mobility and housing.

## Key Responsibilities

- Designing and implementing the backend using Flask for efficient data processing and RESTful APIs
- Developing an interactive frontend with Leaflet.js and Bootstrap 5 for map visualization and responsive UI
- Integrating and processing transport data (bus, tram, velo stations) for accurate accessibility scoring
- Implementing AI-powered features for personalized location recommendations and insights
- Ensuring scalability and performance for real-time user interactions

## Technologies Used

- **Flask** for backend web development
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Shapely** for geometric operations
- **Leaflet.js** for interactive mapping
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive UI
- **JavaScript** for dynamic frontend features
- **OpenStreetMap** data integration

## Challenges and Learnings

Building PubliScore required balancing real-time data processing with user experience. Handling large datasets for transport nodes and ensuring fast, accurate scoring was a key challenge. Integrating multiple data sources and providing meaningful, actionable insights through AI recommendations pushed the boundaries of both backend and frontend development. The project also highlighted the importance of clear UI/UX for complex data visualization.

## Outcome

PubliScore successfully launched as a hackathon project, providing a valuable tool for Antwerp residents and planners. The application received positive feedback for its intuitive interface, comprehensive scoring system, and innovative use of open data. PubliScore demonstrates the power of combining open data, AI, and user-centric design to address real-world urban mobility challenges.
