## Overview

I was a member and the leader of the Robotics team called Technogods

## Key responsabilities

- **Team Management**: I mannaged, organized and bonded with my team, together we passed every hard challange we faced.
- **Programming**: I wrote the code for the robot alongside my other team members.
- **3d CAD designer**: I designed the mechanical parts and the robot itself before making it in the real world.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: We used java to manage and control the robot using an control hub and the rev library.
- **OpenCV**: We used OpenCV to detect certain images and cases to score more points with our robot in the autonomous period.
- **OnShape**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.

## Challenges and Learnings

Managing a team it was harder then expected, I learned to respect everyone and try and give them and take into account multiple opinions and ideas to select the best one.

## Outcome

We had a lot of fun, met a lot of people and learned alot about OpenCV, Java, OnShape and many more.
